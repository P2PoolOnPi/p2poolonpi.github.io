Check the main [GitHub](https://github.com/P2PoolOnPi) and choose your chosen P2Pool to build.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nDonations to this project are always welcome. Especially as building new pools costs for equipment and time.\r\n\r\n* Donations in Doge: DFsJtx8YCVd8fuWj5GFijYcg3RfvZnDd7v\r\n* Donations in Bitcoin: 1AjBcNSvnZsn3ESAH491hUbBrwM4Jmcuy9\r\n* Donations in Litecoin: LMFYddxyfsPw4oxNGQMwLBUohqj7PmwiXH\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 P2PoolOnPi\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

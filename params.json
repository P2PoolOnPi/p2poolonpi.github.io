{"name":"P2Pool on Raspberry Pi","tagline":"Low Latency and Low Power Consumption P2Pool","body":"# I'm creating P2Pools that can run on a [Raspberry Pi](http://amzn.to/1peyhoc)!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTo get started you will need to do a little shopping:\r\n\r\n* [Raspberry Pi B+](http://amzn.to/1peyhoc)\r\n* [Raspberry Pi B+ Case](http://amzn.to/1peyKqq) - Others will do, but this is cheap and well made.\r\n* [Power Supply](http://amzn.to/1peyQOT)\r\n* [SDHC Micro SD Card](http://amzn.to/1peyWWC)\r\n* [Ethernet Cable](http://amzn.to/Y0C6YY) - Recommended.\r\n* [WiFi Dongle](http://amzn.to/Y0C9UD) - Not recommended, but if your only choice.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nInstall Raspbian with floating point support from the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) website.\r\n\r\nYou now have everything you need to start making your P2Pool. Check the main [GitHub](https://github.com/P2PoolOnPi) and choose your chosen P2Pool to build.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nDonations to this project are always welcome. Especially as building new pools costs for equipment and time.\r\n\r\n* Donations in Doge: DFsJtx8YCVd8fuWj5GFijYcg3RfvZnDd7v\r\n* Donations in Bitcoin: 1AjBcNSvnZsn3ESAH491hUbBrwM4Jmcuy9\r\n* Donations in Litecoin: LMFYddxyfsPw4oxNGQMwLBUohqj7PmwiXH\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## FIRE NEWS\r\n\r\nI do not hold [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) or [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) responsible in any way for the events.\r\n\r\nA few days ago I had everything set up running in Jenkins to connect to the Raspberry Pi and attempt to build each of the pools. It would then attempt to mine a share on the P2Pool before resulting in a pass or a failure.\r\n\r\nWell it turns out I must have over stressed the Raspberry Pi with all this testing. This led to a small electrical fire in my testing lab. No serious damage was done, apart from a little breadboard and some cabling. However the Raspberry Pi is damaged beyond repair. I have contacted the retailer who has told me that fire is not covered in their replacement guide. I will contact Raspberry Pi directly, however I have little faith in getting this resolved.\r\n\r\nThis project is on hold until I can get a replacement Raspberry Pi and identify the fault that led to the electrical failure.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 P2PoolOnPi\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

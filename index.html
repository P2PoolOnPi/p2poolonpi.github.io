<hr><p>To get started you will need to do a little shopping:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1peyhoc">Raspberry Pi B+</a></li>
<li>
<a href="http://amzn.to/1peyKqq">Raspberry Pi B+ Case</a> - Others will do, but this is cheap and well made.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1peyQOT">Power Supply</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1peyWWC">SDHC Micro SD Card</a></li>
<li>
<a href="http://amzn.to/Y0C6YY">Ethernet Cable</a> - Recommended.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://amzn.to/Y0C9UD">WiFi Dongle</a> - Not recommended, but if your only choice.</li>
</ul><hr><p>Install Raspbian with floating point support from the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspberry Pi</a> website.</p>

<p>You now have everything you need to start making your P2Pool. Check the main <a href="https://github.com/P2PoolOnPi">GitHub</a> and choose your chosen P2Pool to build.</p>

<hr><p>Donations to this project are always welcome. Especially as building new pools costs for equipment and time.</p>

<p>I do not hold <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> or <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> responsible in any way for the events.</p>

<p>A few days ago I had everything set up running in Jenkins to connect to the Raspberry Pi and attempt to build each of the pools. It would then attempt to mine a share on the P2Pool before resulting in a pass or a failure.</p>

<p>Well it turns out I must have over stressed the Raspberry Pi with all this testing. This led to a small electrical fire in my testing lab. No serious damage was done, apart from a little breadboard and some cabling. However the Raspberry Pi is damaged beyond repair. I have contacted the retailer who has told me that fire is not covered in their replacement guide. I will contact Raspberry Pi directly, however I have little faith in getting this resolved.</p>

<p>This project is on hold until I can get a replacement Raspberry Pi and identify the fault that led to the electrical failure.</p>
